- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overloaded sellCoffee in the cafe class so the user can buy a standard cup with default cream and sugar or customize to their desired amount of each. I also overloaded restock to allow for partial restock or full restock. I overloaded checkout in library class which allows for 1 or multiple books to be checked out at once. In house class I overloaded moveIn, allowing 1 person or a group of people to move in at once.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was a lot easier to organize different types of buildings and their behaviours. Inheritance allowed for efficient reuse of code across different parts of the building.
